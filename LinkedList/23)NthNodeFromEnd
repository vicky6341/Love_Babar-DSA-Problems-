problem:(Nth node from end of linked list).
   Given a linked list consisting of L nodes and given a number N. The task is to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list.

Input:
N = 2
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9
Output: 8
Explanation: In the first example, there
are 9 nodes in linked list and we need
to find 2nd node from end. 2nd node
from end is 8.

                    {
                        //Function to find the data of nth node from the end of a linked list.
                        int getNthFromLast(Node head, int n)
                        {
                            Node fast=head,slow=head;

                            return slow.data;
