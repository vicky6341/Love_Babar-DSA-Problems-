problem:(Value equal to index value)
   Given an array Arr of N positive integers. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).
Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

Input:N = 5
Arr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7}
output: 2
Explaination:  Only Arr[2] = 2 exists here.

Source code:

			class Solution {
				ArrayList<Integer> valueEqualToIndex(int arr[], int n) {
					ArrayList<Integer> l=new ArrayList<>();
					for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
					{
						if(arr[i]==i+1)
						 l.add(arr[i]);
					}
					return l;
				}
			}
			
			
Time Complexity:O(N).
Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of elements which satisfy arr[i]=i+1.
