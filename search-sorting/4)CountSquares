problem:(Count Squares)
   Consider a sample space S consisting of all perfect squares starting from 1, 4, 9 and so on. You are given a number N, you have to output the number of integers less than N in the sample space S.
 
 Input:9
 Output:2
 Explaination:1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares less than 9. So, the Output is 2.
 
 1)Source Code:
  
		   class Solution {
			static int countSquares(int N) {
				int a=(int)Math.sqrt(N);
				if(a*a==N)return a-1;
				else return a;
			}
		}
		
2)Time Complexity:O(sqrt(N)).
3)Space Complexity:O(1).
